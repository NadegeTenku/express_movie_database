# express_movie_database

                     <<WORK FLOW>>
Organized my project schedule with kanban.
Did my relationship diagram with draw.io.
Created my git repo named "express_movie_database, initialized my node project (with jest, express, sequelize & sqlite) and created my models(Movie, Cast & Crew).
Tested my models in small portions and then I added the test instances (single & bulk creations) and models as I passed each test.
Did my assiciations on my index.js file and then later created the server.js file in order to listen on my server(port 3000) and to test CRUD with express on Postman.


                       <<ISSUES>>
Lines 75-78 on index.test.js have an error that I couldn't fix after numerous attempts.
Lines 87 & 88 show errors that I could not fix as well. Please help me look at that entire section that I commented out for possible errors.
Got an error message when I ran node index.js. I tried but didn't succeed in debugging it. Image linked below.
Could not GET my models to listen on my server.
Could not CRUD the models on my postman due to the unsolved issue with node index.js.
